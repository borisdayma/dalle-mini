# DALL·E Mini

_Generate images from a text prompt_

<img src="img/logo.png" width="200">

Our logo was generated with DALL·E mini using the prompt "logo of an armchair in the shape of an avocado".

You can create your own pictures with [this demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/flax-community/dalle-mini), or spin off your own playground and experiement with a full-stack app using the [DALL-E Playground repository](https://github.com/saharmor/dalle-playground).

## How does it work?

Refer to [our report](https://wandb.ai/dalle-mini/dalle-mini/reports/DALL-E-mini--Vmlldzo4NjIxODA).

## Development

### Dependencies Installation

For development, use [`dev/requirements.txt`](dev/requirements.txt) or [`dev/environment.yaml`](dev/environment.yaml).

### Training of VQGAN

The VQGAN was trained using [taming-transformers](https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers).

We recommend using the latest version available.

### Conversion of VQGAN to JAX

Use [patil-suraj/vqgan-jax](https://github.com/patil-suraj/vqgan-jax).

### Training of Seq2Seq

Refer to [`dev/seq2seq`](dev/seq2seq) folder.

You can also adjust the [sweep configuration file](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps) if you need to perform a hyperparameter search.

### Inference Pipeline

To generate sample predictions and understand the inference pipeline step by step, refer to [`dev/inference/inference_pipeline.ipynb`](dev/inference/inference_pipeline.ipynb).

## FAQ

### Where to find the latest models?

Trained models are on 🤗 Model Hub:

- [VQGAN-f16-16384](https://huggingface.co/flax-community/vqgan_f16_16384) for encoding/decoding images
- [DALL·E mini](https://huggingface.co/flax-community/dalle-mini) for generating images from a text prompt

### Where does the logo come from?

The "armchair in the shape of an avocado" was used by OpenAI when releasing DALL·E to illustrate the model's capabilities. Having successful predictions on this prompt represents a big milestone to us.
