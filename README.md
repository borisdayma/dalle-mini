_Generate images from a text prompt_

<img src="https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini/raw/main/img/logo.png" width="200">

Our logo was generated with DALL¬∑E mini using the prompt "logo of an armchair in the shape of an avocado".

## How to use it?

There are several ways to use DALL¬∑E mini to create your own images:

* use [the app at üñçÔ∏è craiyon](https://www.craiyon.com/)

* experiment with the pipeline step by step through our [`inference pipeline notebook`](tools/inference/inference_pipeline.ipynb)

  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/borisdayma/dalle-mini/blob/main/tools/inference/inference_pipeline.ipynb)

You can also use these great projects from the community:

* spin off your own app with [DALL-E Playground repository](https://github.com/saharmor/dalle-playground) (thanks [Sahar](https://twitter.com/theaievangelist))

* try [DALL¬∑E Flow](https://github.com/jina-ai/dalle-flow) project for generating, diffusion, and upscaling in a Human-in-the-Loop workflow (thanks [Han Xiao](https://github.com/hanxiao))

  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jina-ai/dalle-flow/blob/main/client.ipynb)

* run on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini), in the browser or via API

## How does it work?

## Contributing

Join the community on the [LAION Discord](https://discord.gg/xBPBXfcFHd).
Any contribution is welcome, from reporting issues to proposing fixes/improvements or testing the model with cool prompts!

## Development

### Dependencies Installation

For inference only, use `pip install git+https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini.git`.

For development, clone the repo and use `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
Before making a PR, check style with `make style`.

### Training of DALL¬∑E mini

Use [`tools/train/train.py`](tools/train/train.py).

You can also adjust the [sweep configuration file](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps) if you need to perform a hyperparameter search.

## FAQ

### Where to find the latest models?

Trained models are on ü§ó Model Hub:

* [VQGAN-f16-16384](https://huggingface.co/dalle-mini/vqgan_imagenet_f16_16384) for encoding/decoding images
* [DALL¬∑E mini](https://huggingface.co/flax-community/dalle-mini) for generating images from a text prompt

### Where does the logo come from?

The "armchair in the shape of an avocado" was used by OpenAI when releasing DALL¬∑E to illustrate the model's capabilities. Having successful predictions on this prompt represents a big milestone for us.
